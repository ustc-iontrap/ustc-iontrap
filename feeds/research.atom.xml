The function of the quantum node is the operation and storage of the quantum state, and the function of the quantum channel is the distribution of quantum information [1]. Shown in Fig.1.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Much experimental progress has been achieved in this aspect for different physical systems, such as atomic ensembles, single atoms and trapped ions [2,3,4]. In comparison, hybrid quantum networks consisting of various physical systems [5] can combine the different advantages of diverse physical systems. 
In our group, we try to build a hybrid quantum network combined with trapped ion and rare-earth doped solid state quantum memory. Shown in Fig.2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p class="caption"&gt;Fig.2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the computing nodes, trapped ions can be a suitable candidate because they are one of the most promising physical systems for the realization of quantum computation and simulation [6, 7].
For the storing nodes, a promising candidate is the rare-earth ion-doped crystal system, because it has already shown excellent merits in regard to quantum memory [8,9,10]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, photonic interface compatible with the physical systems in hybrid quantum network are not identical. Considering the functions and aims, there are some requirements to get a well-fitted photonic interface. The central frequency and bandwidth of the photons should be matched perfectly with the physical systems in hybrid quantum network.Last but not least, entanglement should be existed in this progress. To satisfy the requirements, generation of nondegenerate narrow-band entangled photon pairs will be a good proposal to reach the goal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As shown in Fig.3. We came up with a newly-designed conjoined double-cavity structure to generate the nondegenerate entangled narrow-band photon pairs firstly in experiment. By tomography, we get a source with fidelity of xx%.&lt;/p&gt;

Using photons as the flying qubits to link the remote nodes is the key technology in quantum network. Both schemes based on quantum state transfer (between the photons and atoms) and remote entanglement generation (by aid of photons) are the solutions. Aiming on the quantum state transfer scheme, which requires strong coupling between single photon and single atom, lots of work have been done including integrating a fiber Fabry&amp;ndash;P&amp;eacute;rot cavity to improve the coupling factor. However there is still a long way to transfer the state of an atom to another atom. On the other hand, although quantum teleportation between ions had been realized basing on entanglement generation scheme, the quite low state preparing rate, which is confined by the photon collection efficiency, limits its application.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We plan to use a fiber Fabry&amp;ndash;P&amp;eacute;rot cavity to enhance the collection efficiency of photons, which is based on fluorescence Purcell enhancement with a moderate cooperativity. The cavity is design in the ultraviolet range, which is resonant with dipole transition of Yb ion. The loss of mirror coatings in ultraviolet range is much larger than the coatings in infrared range, the ultraviolet cavity cannot support quantum state transfer scheme well. However, the cavity still have a good cooperativity for florescence enhancement. As the enhanced florescence couple into the cavity mode, the cavity can collect most part fluorescence of the ion when the Purcell enhancement is larger than 1. Utilizing a large core fiber to match the cavity mode and fiber mode, the collected photons can be well coupled in to a single mode fiber. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have made the ultraviolet fiber cavity, the result shows that the cavity supports Purcell enhancement well while keeping a high transmission. Simulations show a single-mode fiber collection efficiency over 50%. This technology can provide ultra-bright single photon sources based on trapped ions, supporting high entanglement generation rate in quantum network.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry></feed>
